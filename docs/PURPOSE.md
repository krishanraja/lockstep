# Purpose

## Mission Statement

**To transform chaotic event coordination into seamless, joyful experiences where organizers feel in control and guests feel informed.**

## Why Lockstep Exists

### The Origin Story

Every complex event—a wedding weekend, a bachelor party, a corporate retreat—devolves into the same chaos:

1. Someone creates a group chat
2. Critical information gets buried in memes and reactions
3. The organizer asks "who's coming to dinner Saturday?" for the fifth time
4. Half the group never responds
5. Plans change, but not everyone gets the update
6. The organizer burns out before the event even starts

Lockstep was born from this frustration. We believe that organizing should enhance the experience, not detract from it.

## Core Beliefs

### 1. Complexity Deserves Structure
Multi-day events with multiple activities aren't "just parties"—they're logistical challenges that deserve proper tools.

### 2. Friction Kills Participation
Every password, every extra click, every confusing interface reduces response rates. Magic links and mobile-first design remove friction.

### 3. Organizers Need Visibility
Not just "who said yes" but "who said yes to the boat trip specifically." Block-level granularity provides actionable data.

### 4. Automation Should Feel Human
Smart nudges that respect timing, channel preferences, and response history—not spam.

### 5. Beautiful Design Builds Trust
A polished interface signals that the event is organized, encouraging guests to take it seriously.

## What We're NOT

- ❌ Not a general calendar tool
- ❌ Not a project management app
- ❌ Not a social network
- ❌ Not trying to replace group chats entirely

We're a focused tool for a specific problem: getting clear RSVPs for complex events.

## Long-term Vision

Lockstep becomes the default way to coordinate any event more complex than a simple dinner party. Event organizers (professional and personal) can't imagine going back to spreadsheets and group chats.

## Guiding Principles for Development

1. **Mobile-first**: 80%+ of guests will RSVP from their phones
2. **Instant value**: Organizers should see benefit within 5 minutes
3. **Graceful degradation**: Works without JavaScript, works on slow connections
4. **Privacy by default**: Guests don't see each other's contact info unless organizer chooses
5. **Delightful details**: Animations, sounds, and micro-interactions that spark joy
