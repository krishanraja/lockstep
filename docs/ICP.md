- **Gender**: Skews female (65%) but significant male representation

### Current Behavior
- Creates dedicated group chats for events

### Pain Points (Verbatims)

> "The group chat has 500 messages and I can't find the dietary restrictions anyone mentioned."

> "I don't want to be that person who keeps asking, but I need to give numbers to the venue."

### Desired Outcomes
- Know exactly who's attending each activity
- Stop manually chasing non-responders
- Look organized and professional
- Reduce personal stress and anxiety

## Anti-Personas (Who We're NOT For)

- Needs: Registration, ticketing, badge printing
- Why not: Enterprise tools (Cvent, Eventbrite) are better suited

- Needs: Simple scheduling
- Why not: Calendly, When2meet, or just Slack works
