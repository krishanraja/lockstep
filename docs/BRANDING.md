## Messaging Framework

### Core Message

**For event organizers who are overwhelmed by the chaos of planning complex, multi-activity gatherings**, Lockstep is a **smart RSVP platform** that **gives you block-by-block visibility into who's attending what**, unlike Google Forms or group chats that leave you guessing.

### Key Messages by Audience

#### For Organizers
> "Finally know exactly who's coming to what—no more guessing, no more chasing."

#### For Guests
> "RSVP in seconds, update anytime. No app download, no password."

#### For Event Professionals
> "Premium RSVP experience that makes you look good to clients."

### Elevator Pitches

**10-second**:
> "Lockstep is like RSVP, but for each activity at your event—not just the event itself."

**30-second**:
> "Planning a wedding weekend? Lockstep lets guests respond to each activity separately—ceremony, reception, brunch. You see exactly who's attending what, send smart reminders, and stop drowning in group chat chaos."

**60-second**:
> "Traditional RSVPs fail for complex events. Guests say 'yes' but you still don't know if they're coming to Friday dinner or just Saturday. Lockstep breaks your event into blocks—each activity gets its own RSVP. Guests tap through a beautiful mobile experience in 30 seconds. You get a dashboard showing attendance projections for every block, plus automated reminders that actually get responses. No more spreadsheets, no more nagging texts."

## Brand Story

### The Origin

Every complex event tells the same story:

It starts with excitement. A wedding weekend! A bachelor trip! Then reality sets in. Someone creates a group chat. Information gets buried. The organizer asks "who's coming to dinner Friday?" seventeen times. Half the group never responds. Plans change but not everyone sees the update.

By the time the event arrives, the organizer is exhausted—and the celebration hasn't even started.

**Lockstep was born from this chaos.**

We believe that organizing should enhance the experience, not drain it. That beautiful tools inspire better responses. That technology should work for humans, not the other way around.

So we built the RSVP platform we wished existed: block-by-block clarity, magic-link simplicity, and just enough automation to save your sanity.

**Because life's big moments deserve better than a group chat.**

## Competitive Positioning

### Against Google Forms
> "Forms are for surveys. Lockstep is for celebrations."

### Against Paperless Post
> "Beautiful invitations are great. Knowing who's coming to which activity is better."

### Against Group Chats
> "Stop scrolling to find who said what. See it all in one dashboard."

### Against Spreadsheets
> "Guests don't update spreadsheets. They tap buttons on their phone."
