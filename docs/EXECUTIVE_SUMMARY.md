# Executive Summary

## What is Lockstep?

Lockstep is a modern RSVP and event coordination platform designed to eliminate the chaos of multi-day, multi-activity events. It provides event organizers with intelligent tools to manage complex schedules, track guest responses at a granular level, and automate communication—all through a beautiful, mobile-first interface.

## The Problem

Traditional RSVP tools fail for complex events:
- **Weddings** with ceremonies, receptions, and after-parties
- **Bachelor/ette weekends** spanning multiple days and activities
- **Corporate retreats** with optional sessions and breakout groups
- **Family reunions** with varied activities across generations

Guests receive endless group texts, organizers lose track of who's attending what, and everyone ends up confused.

## The Solution

Lockstep introduces **block-based RSVPs**—guests respond to individual time blocks, not just the overall event. Organizers see real-time attendance projections for every activity, and smart nudges ensure responses without nagging.

## Key Differentiators

1. **Block-level granularity**: Know exactly who's attending each activity
2. **Magic link authentication**: No passwords, no friction for guests
3. **AI-powered summaries**: Instant insights from guest responses
4. **Multi-channel nudges**: SMS, WhatsApp, and email reminders
5. **Beautiful mobile experience**: Designed for phones first

## Business Model

- **Free tier**: Unlimited events, up to 15 guests/event, 3 nudges/event
- **Pro tier**: $29/event, up to 75 guests, 20 nudges, AI summaries, WhatsApp
- **Wedding tier**: $49/event, up to 150 guests, unlimited nudges, priority AI, CSV export
- **Business tier**: $99/event, up to 200 guests, unlimited features, team access, analytics
- **Annual Pro**: $149/year, unlimited events with Pro features
