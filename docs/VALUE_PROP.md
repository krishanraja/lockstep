# Value Proposition

## One-liner

**Lockstep: Block-by-block RSVPs for events that deserve more than "yes" or "no."**

## Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

Planning a wedding weekend? Bachelor party? Corporate retreat? Traditional RSVPs don't cut it. Lockstep lets guests respond to each activity separately—ceremony vs. reception, boat trip vs. dinner, keynote vs. breakout session. You see exactly who's attending what, send smart reminders to non-responders, and keep everyone in sync. No more group chat chaos.
